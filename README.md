# Java Learning Repository
This repository contains all my code, notes, and exercises from two main learning resources:

Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization on Coursera
Head First Java book

- Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to consolidate all my learning materials, code examples, and notes as I progress through both the Coursera specialization and Head First Java. This repository serves as my personal reference and a record of my Java programming journey.

For additional notes, you can refer to my Notion page: Java programming notes - Head First Java notes : https://smiling-litter-f21.notion.site/Java-programming-notes-Head-First-Java-notes-11dae9ccb01880ed9ec7fc714c630cca

Exercise Code: Code files for specific exercises or challenges.
Practice Projects: Additional small projects to reinforce chapter concepts.
Notes: Some chapters include a NOTES.md file summarizing key points or complex parts of the chapter.

- Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed.
Text Editor or IDE: You can use any text editor, but IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse is recommended for Java development.

- How to Use This Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone [repository URL]

Navigate to the chapter or module directory you wish to explore.
Compile and run the Java files using a terminal or your preferred IDE.

- Baked Code Repository

Some of the exercises in the Head First Java book refer to code snippets or "baked" code provided by the authors. You can find these additional resources and starting code at the following link:

- Baked Code - Head First Java Examples

This resource contains pre-written code for certain exercises, which may be used as a base for solving some of the more complex challenges in the book.

- License

This repository is intended for educational purposes and to complement the exercises in Head First Java. Please ensure you have a legal copy of the book before using the code here, as the exercises and examples are intended to be used alongside the book content.
